# AddressOfEntryPoint_Hijack_CSharp

Blog link: not gonna update


- Shellcode injection or execution via AddressOfEntryPoint hijack.
- Base on my other projects down below:
	1. [MappingInjection](https://github.com/Kara-4search/MappingInjection_CSharp)
	2. [HookDetection](https://github.com/Kara-4search/HookDetection_CSharp)
	3. [PEB-PPIDspoofing](https://github.com/Kara-4search/PEB-PPIDspoofing_Csharp)
	
- Tested on Win10/x64
- Steps
	1. Create a process in a suspended status with "CreateProcess".
	2. Finding process's PEB address.
	3. Finding the process's "ImageBase_address" via PEB.
	4. Finding the RVA(AddressOfEntryPoint) via ImageBase_address(Function: Locate_AddressOfEntryPoint).
	5. AddressOfEntryPoint_address = ImageBase_address + RVA.
	6. Write your shellcode(buf1) into AddressOfEntryPoint_address with "WriteProcessMemory".
	
- **NOTE: If you use NtWriteVirtualMemory insteal of WriteProcessMemory, you gonna get an error.if you really want to use NtWriteVirtualMemory, you may need to change the protect status of the page.
- In this technique we don't need to allocate RWX memory pages in the victim process which some EDRs may not like.
- buf1 down below is a messagebox.
```
	/* MessageBox */
	byte[] buf1 = new byte[323] {
